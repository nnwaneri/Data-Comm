For this project, you will develop two network programs, one for client and one for server. The client will send a file containing units to the server. The server will then translate the units to the format specified by the client, and saves the units to a file of the name, which is also specified by the client. Before translating the units, the server checks if received units have a correct format. If not, the server sends back an error message immediately without saving the file. If yes, the server sends back a confirmation message after saving the file. The client prints the result, "Format error" or "Success", after getting the message from the server, then quits. The server keeps running and waits for another client to connect.
